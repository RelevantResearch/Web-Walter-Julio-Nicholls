description: Explore a collection of images that reflect the breadth and depth of my work, from engaging with students in the classroom to conducting field research in diverse urban settings. This gallery captures moments that highlight my research on the role of cities in social movements, immigrant political agency, and urban sociology. Each photo represents the ongoing effort to connect academic inquiry with real-world action, fostering a deeper understanding of social change, immigration, and community resilience. These images also offer a glimpse into the spaces where transformative ideas and actions take shape, both in the classroom and within the communities I study.
